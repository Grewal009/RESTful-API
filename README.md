## What is REST?

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**.

It is an architectural sytle that defines a set of rules/constraints to be used for creating web services.

RESTful API is an API that follows to the rules of REST.

RESTful API also known as RESTful services or REST services.

Generally, we use RESTful API's to perform **CRUD** (create, read, update and delete) operations.

- PATCH -> update existing data partially
- DELETE -> remove/delete data
